# Startup Framework Site Builder

This app uses the [Startup Framework](https://designmodo.com/startup) which is an online webpage builder,
which allows you to compose pages from a library of blocks, hundreds of them, which are categorized in groups
like headers, navigations, contact forms, footers, etc.

Once you've cloned the repo, you can provide your Deisgn Modo login credentials and run a series of scripts which will
convert the HTML of each of their blocks into React components, and downloads the assets and dependencies.

You can create multiple sites, each site will have multiple pages, each page will contain an arbitrary combination of blocks.
