# Startup Framework

The Startup Framework is created by Designmodo.

It can be used to create web pages which consist of an arbitrary combination of full width content blocks,
that can be stacked top to bottom.

There are many different categories of content blocks, such as headers, footers, pricing tables, e-commerce blocks, etc.
