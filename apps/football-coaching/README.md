# Football Coaching Helper

I usually use an app for this called TeamSnap that is great, but I'm developing this myself to manage some aspects that the app does not.

It is powered 100% by google spreadsheets and google calendars, and uses gmail to send emails for me.

## Features

### Roster Management

- Manage your teams roster, including parent contact information, and notes

### Schedule Management

- Schedule practices, games, etc
- Notes about each game, to help send parent highlights
- Allow parents to volunteer to be camera / video
- Allow parents to volunteer to bring snacks
- Attendance tracking

### Equal Play Manager

- Once games are scheduled, generate player position charts for each half of each game.
- Every player should play at least one half at each position on offense and defense.
- If adjustments need to be made because of attendance or other game time conditions, the remaining schedules should adjust, and help make fair choices

### Communication

Send mailing list style updates to players and parents.
