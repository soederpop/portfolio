# Football Coaching Helper

> Early Stages, in Development

I coach my son's football team, which has an equal play rule that allows every team member an opportunity to play every position at least once in the season.

This app generates player charts for each game to ensure that everyone has had the chance to throw a winning touchdown pass.

It also helps me manage player -> parent communication to keep them up to date on how their child is doing, and to manage scheduling and availability in case
adjustments need to be made on game day. Shuffling around the player charts for the following weeks, if need be, to ensure we can allow that child to make up
their chance to play a certain position.
